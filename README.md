# Carter's Config Auto Installer

This script will automatically install all of the packages needed to get my system up and running, as well as install my custom builds of dwm, st, slstatus and dmenu.

## Installation

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarterDavis03/autoinstall/main/installer.sh
sh ./installer.sh
```

## Further Information

This script is primarily for me to quickly reinstall my OS when moving to a new drive or when I get a new device, therefore there is very limited customisation options.
